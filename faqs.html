                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><strong>INTRODUCTION :</strong></span><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1.       What is Model United Nations?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Model United Nations is an authentic simulation of the UN General Assembly and other multilateral bodies like G20, G77 et cetera, where students step into the shoes of ambassadors from the UN member states to debate current issues on the organization’s agenda.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2.       How did Model UN begin?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Model United Nations began as a series of student-led Model League of Nations simulations. When these simulations began they were called as International Assembly, the first of which was held at Oxford University in November 1921. Two years later, in 1923, the simulations were introduced at Harvard University where they gained popularity. After the Second World War, Model League of Nations transitioned to Model United Nations due to the formation of the League’s successor organization, the United Nations, in 1945.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3.       Are MUNs popular?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The popularity of Model UN continues to grow, and an estimated 400,000 middle school, high school, and college/university students worldwide participate every year.</div><div><br></div><div>Many of today’s leaders in law, government, business, and the arts participated in Model UN during their academic careers. Model UN has been receiving attention in the mainstream media and has been featured in television programmes including ‘Community, Parks and Recreation’, ‘The Simpsons’, ‘Like Family’, ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’, ‘Will and Grace’, ‘The OC’, and ‘Gossip Girl’. Model UN was the theme of the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie ‘Winning London’ and was also mentioned in movies such as ‘The Sure Thing’ and ‘Along Came Polly’.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4.       What is TNV Youth Forum?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The New Visionaries is a young non-profit organization established by youthful students in February of 2021. The organization was the brain child of Adnan Ali Abid, currently an undergraduate student at SPIR, Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad.It came as a result of the effort to enhance the knowledge and intellect of students by themselves without waiting for a guide or a mentor. Started with a minimalist manifesto, TNV has now grown in a matter of two years into a fully non-funded non-profit organization that is a platform for all the motivated learners of world affairs. It has its chapters in all the main universities of twin cities.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5.       What is the TNVMUN?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The New Visionaries Model United Nations (TNVMUN) is an initiative by the TNV Youth Forum in collaboration with National Law College, Rawalpindi. It strives to foster a constructive forum for open dialogue on complex global issues amongst the student community. Each year delegates debate and deliberate on topics simulating actual United Nations proceedings. This gives students the opportunity to broaden their vision, and also to hone their diplomatic, public speaking, and leadership skills.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6.       Who is a Model United Nations delegate?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>A Model United Nations delegate is a student who assumes the role of an ambassador, represents the country that has been assigned to him/her for all matters at the Model United Nations, makes speeches, prepares draft resolutions, negotiates with allies and adversaries, resolves conflicts, and navigates the Model UN conference rules of procedure – all in the interest of mobilising international cooperation to resolve problems that affect countries all over the world.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7.       Why should I participate in the TNVMUN?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The multiple benefits of participating in TNVMUN include:</div><div><br></div><div>Increase in awareness about the salient role played by the United Nations in global affairs; serve as a Model of Best Practices of the United Nations.</div><div>Self-improvement via networking with delegates, improving your planning process, and inspiring oneself as future leaders to become involved in world issues.</div><div>Development of reading, reference, and research skills, improvement in skills of note taking and technical writing (drafting resolutions and working papers), and policy analysis.</div><div>Enhancement of communication skills, especially in the areas of public speaking, small group communications, active listening, negotiation, and conflict resolution.</div><div>Gain insight into foreign policies and their effect on world politics.</div><div>Achieve a deeper understanding of different cultures and how to appreciate and support diversity</div><div>Encourage oneself to contribute towards a better global social interaction.</div><div>Increase in the in-depth knowledge of various countries, leading to a guaranteed lively and memorable experience.</div><div><strong>8.

What are some of the educational benefits of TNVMUN?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>TNVMUN is an interactive learning experience.

These significant skills include research, writing, public speaking, problem-solving, consensus building, and cooperation. It adds value to the CVs of student delegates and equips them for the real world.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>10.    What types of topics are discussed in TNVMUN conferences?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Conferences tend to focus on current world affairs and issues that are being discussed in the United Nations. These issues can highlight political, financial and/or social concerns. The task of some committees might be to address hypothetical concerns or issues from the past or future. For example, many conferences have “crisis” committees, in which delegates must react to a hypothetical or actual crisis situation. The agenda items discussed in committees vary at each conference. Other conferences host historical or future Security Council simulations.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>11.

On what basis should I choose my committee?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>First and foremost, your preference should be dependent on your interest. Each committee at TNVMUN caters to a specific political and social program, and some have atypical set-ups. Understand their history, read associated agendas and then decide. Secondly, keep in mind your experience as well as ease with the size of a committee. Ensure your decision of preference is a combination of these factors.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>16.    The agenda of my committee isn’t relevant to my assigned nation. Does this mean I won’t be a part of the debate?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>No, all delegates in any committee are encouraged to be a part of the debate. Your research can be agenda specific, with your country skilfully integrated in your response. Get familiar with your countries’ general policies before you frame your stance.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>17.    I am a first time Munner. What should I expect?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>An intellectual challenge!

What is the dress code for delegates?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Dress professionally and appropriately as it is an important aspect of Model United Nations preparations.

It includes wearing a suit – pants, a matching jacket, a button down dress shirt, and a tie.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>SESSIONS AND RELATED QUERIES:</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>19.

What is caucusing?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Caucusing is an informal debate that occurs during the TNVMUN conference. It serves as an important method of discussion because it allows for greater participation and consensus building. Caucusing can be either ‘moderated’ when speakers are called on by the chair after raising their placards or ‘unmoderated’, which is a designated time for delegates without the intervention of the chair to have discussion and work on resolutions. The caucuses are preliminary proceedings.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>24.
